Detection Improvements
======================
Ask::Wx, Ask::Tk, Ask::Gtk2 should not assume they are usable because they could load. They should e.g. detect if an X server is running.

New Backends
============
Ask::Win32 - a native Win32 thing. Perhaps write a zenity-like command-line tool and wrap that?


Backend Improvements
====================
Ask::STDIO - better file selection method
Ask::Wx - support multi file selection
